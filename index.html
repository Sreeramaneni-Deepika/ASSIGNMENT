          Motivation theory is the study of understanding what drives a person
          to work towards a particular goal or outcome. It’s relevant to all of
          society but is especially important to business and management. That’s
          because a motivated employee is more productive, and a more productive
          employee is more profitable. Indeed, research has shown that happy,
          motivated employees can increase productivity by around 12%.
